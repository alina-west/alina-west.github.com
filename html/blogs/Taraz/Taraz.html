    <h2>History</h2>
<p>Taraz is standing on the site of ancient city of Taraz, which flourished as a stop along Silk Road from Europe to China until it was destroyed by Mongol armies in the 13th century.

    A new town called Aulie-Ata was established on the site by the emirs of Kokand in the late 18th century. The fort and town were captured by Russians in 1864, and in 1938 the town was renamed after Kazakh poet Jam-bul Jabayev (Russian: Zhambyl Dzhabayev; 1846-1945).
    
    Phosphorite ore which was found in nearest mountain Karatau predetermined development of phosphorite industry in the region. 3 chemical plants were constructed in the city at once.
    
    The collapse of USSR destroyed all the industrial ties and these plants were in heavy crisis. Unemployment was high in the city. Recently all the plants have been almost restored.
    
    On January 8th, 1997, by Kazakhstan President's decree the city Zhambyl was renamed into Taraz. In autumn 2002 Taraz celebrated its 2,000th anniversary.
    
    Present day Taraz city has large phosphate-processing works, a large power station, sugar, leather, and footwear factories and a wool-washing plant.</p>
